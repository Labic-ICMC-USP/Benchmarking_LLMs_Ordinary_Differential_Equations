0,"A population of protozoa grows at a constant relative rate of 0.7944 per individual per day.     On day zero, the population consists of two protozoa.      Calculate the population size after six days?","We have dP/dt = kP  Therefore dP/dt = 0,7944P →   dP/P = 0,7944dt  → lnP= 0,7944t+c → P =Ce^(0,7944t) and since p(0)=2, we have C=2  and P(t)= 2e^(0,7944t). Hence P(6)= 2e^(0,7944*6) =234,99. Therefore after 6 days we have a population of 235.",235
1,"A tank contains 1000 L of salt water with 15 kg of dissolved salt. Pure water enters the tank at a rate of 10 L/min. The solution is kept well-mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. Calculate how much salt remains in the tank after 20 minutes.","Let  S(t)  be the amount of salt (in kilograms) in the tank at time  t  (in minutes). Since the inflow and outflow rates are equal, the volume in the tank remains constant at 1000 liters. We are given that:    Inflow of pure water: no salt is added;    Outflow: the concentration of salt at time  t  is  S(t)/1000  kg/L;   Outflow rate of salt:  10 * S(t)/1000 = 1/100 S(t)  kg/min. Thus, the rate of change of salt in the tank is:  dS/dt = -1/100 S(t)   → dS/S = -1/100 dt Integrate both sides:  ∫ 1/S dS = ∫ -1/100  dt → ln |S| = -t/100 + C → S(t) = Ce^(-t/100) Applying the initial condition S(0) = 15 , we have:  S(0) = C * e^0 = C → C = 15 Hence,   S(t) = 15 e^(-t/100) Calculating the amount of salt at t = 20 , we have   S(20) = 15 e^(-20/100) = 15 e^(-0.2) Using the approximation  e^(-0.2) ≈ 0.8187 :  S(20) ≈ 15 * 0.8187 = 12.28 kg   Therefore, after 20 minutes, we have  approximately 12,3 kg",12.3
2,"A resistor R=10Ω and an inductor L=2H are connected in series with a DC voltage source of 20 Volts. If the circuit is switched on at t=0, find the initial current I(0)?","Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law KVL, the sum of voltage drops across the resistor and the inductor equals the applied voltage, we have: LdI(t)/dt+RI(t)=V. Substituting the values of V=20,  R=10  and L=2 in the equation above,  we have 2dI(t)/dt+ 10I(t)=20  → dI(t)/dt+5I(t)=10. Solving  the  equation using integrating factor, we have  I(t)=2 + c/e^(5t)  and using the initial condition  I(0)=0 we have I(t)=2 -2/e^(5t) . Therefore, after  t=0, we have 0 A",0
3,"A 5μF capacitor is charged through a 10kΩ resistor from a 12V battery.  Calculate how long will it take for the voltage across the capacitor to reach 8V?","In an RC charging circuit,  Kirchhoff's voltage law KVL gives: V0=VR(t)+VC(t) and the ODE for V0 is given by :  V0=RCdVC(t)/dt+ Vc(t) → dVC(t)/dt= (V0-Vc(t))/RC  → dVC(t)/(V0-Vc(t))= dt/RC. Integrating both sides, we have: -ln|V0-Vc(t)|=t/RC + C1 When t=0, we have C1=-lnV0 hence -ln|V0-Vc(t)|=t/RC -lnV0  → ln|V0-Vc(t)|=lnV0-t/RC. Exponentiating both sides, we have V0-Vc(t)=V0e^(-t/RC)  → Vc(t)=V0-V0e^(-t/RC). And when Vc(t)=8 using, C=5μF=5*10^(-6)F,C=10kΩ and V0=12V, we need to simplify the equation and thereafter calculate for t. Hence, 8=12 -12e^(-t/RC) → t=-RC ln(1/3). Substituting the values of R and C, we have, t=-10^4* 5*10^(-6)* ln(1/3)≈ 0.0549. Therefore, it will take approximately 0.0549 seconds.",0.0549

The rate of cooling is proportional to the difference between the object's temperature and the room temperature. If after 10 minutes the temperature is 150°C. Find the temperature after 20 minutes.","Let T(t) represent the temperature of the object at time t. By Newton’s Law of Cooling, the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference between T(t) and the ambient temperature Troom=25^0 C. We have dT(t)/dt=-k(T(t)-25). Solving this equation, we have dT(t)/(T(t)-25)=-kdt  and integrating both sides we have ln |T(t)-25| =-kt + C and exponentiating we have  T(t)-25=Ae^(-kt) . Applying the initial condition T (0)=200  to find the value of A,  we have  T(t)=25+175e^(-kt) . Now we know that after 10 minutes, T(10)=150^0C . Substituting this into the equation to find the value of k, we have  125=175e^(-10k)  →125/175=e^(-10k)  → 0.7143=e^(-10k). Taking the natural logarithm, we have ln(0.7143)=−10k  →  k=−ln(0.7143)/10≈ 0.0337 . So, after 20 minutes, the temperature will be  T(20)=25+175 e^(-0,337*20) ≈ 25+175^(-0,674) ≈114.19",114.19

After 3 years, the population  decreased to 8,000. Determine the time it will take for the population to reduce to 5,000?","Let P(t) be the population at time t. The rate of population decrease is proportional to the population: dP/dt=-kP where k is the decay constant. Solving this ODE,  we have P(t)=Ae^(-kt). Applying initial condition, P(0)=10,000, we have A=10,000 → P(t)=10,000e^(-kt). After 3 years, the population is 8,000. Substituting  P(3)=8,000 into the equation and calculating the value of k, we have 8,000/10,000=e^(-3k)→ ln(0.8)=-3k  → k=−ln(0.8)/3 ≈ 0.0749 . Hence P(t)=10,000e^(-0,0749t) .Now setting  P(t)=5,000 and solving for t, we have  5,000 =10,000e^(-0,0749t)→ 5,000/10,000=e^(-0,0749t)   → t=−ln(0.5)/0,0749≈ 9.26  years. Therefore it will take approximately 9.26 years for the population to reduce to 5,000 people",9.26

Using q(0)=−0.05 and calculating the value of k, we have k=−0.0592 and hence q(t)=0.0092* cos150t+ 0.055* sin150t-0,0592e^(-25t) . Therefore, when t=0,2, we have q(0,2)=0.0092* cos150*0,2+ 0.055* sin150*0,2-0,0592e^(-25*0,2)≈-0,0529  coulomb.",-0.0529

Solving  the  equation using integrating factor and then,  using  the integration formula (found in our standard integral table): ∫ e^(mt)cosntdt = e^(mt)/(m^2+n^2)(mcosnt+nsinnt) ,we have  I(t)=15e^(-3t)[  e^(3t)/303(sin30t – 10cos30t)] + ke^(-3t)  I(t) =5/101 (sin30t – 10cos30t) + ke^(-3t) and using the initial condition  I(0)=0 we have I(t)=5/101(sin30t – 10cos30t) + 50/101e^(-3t) .

If the temperature of the chicken is 150°F after half an hour,  calculate the temperature after 45 minutes?","Let T(t) represent the temperature of the roasted chicken at time t. By Newton’s Law of Cooling, the rate of cooling is proportional to the difference between T(t) and the ambient temperature T(t)=75^0F.   dT(t)/dt= -k(T(t)-75). Solving this equation, we have dT(t)/(T(t)-75)=-kdt and integrating both sides we have ln|T(t)-75|=-kt + C and exponentiating we have T(t)-75=Ae^(-kt). Applying the initial condition T(0)=185 to find the value of A,  we have T(t)=75+110e^(-kt). Now we know that after 30 minutes, T(30)=150. Substituting this into the equation to find the value of k, we have 75=110e^(-30k) → 75/110=e^(-30k) → 0.6818=e^(-30k). Taking the natural logarithm, we have ln(0.6818)=-30k →k=−ln(0.6818)/30≈0.01296.   So, after 45 minutes, the temperature will be T(45)=75+110e^(-0,01296*45)  ≈136.40^0F.",136.40
9,"Escherichia coli, a common bacteria found in the human intestine, divides into two cells every 20 minutes when placed in a nutrient-rich medium. The initial population of the culture is 60 cells.  Calculate the time required for the population to reach 20,000 cells?","We have dP/dt = kP. Integrating both sides, we have  ln P(t)=kt +C  and using natural logarithm, we have P(t)=Ae^(kt). Since P(0)=60, we have P(t)=60e^(kt). We know that the population doubles every 20 minutes. This means that after 20 minutes, P(20)=2*60=$120 → P(20)=2*60=120 cells. Substituting t=20 in the equation and calculating the value for k we have, k=ln2/20 → 0,03466 and therefore  P(t)=60e^(0,03466t). Now we have to find the value of t when P(t)=20000. We have 20000= 60e^(0,03466t) → 20000/60= e^(0,03466t) → t=ln(333.33)/0.03466 ≈167.63 minutes.",167.63

In what time will we have a total profit of 200,000 kwanzas?","We have dA/dt = kA  Therefore dA/dt = 0,04A →  dA/t = 0,04dt  → lnA= 0,04t+c → A =Ce^(0,04t) and since A(0)=2, we have C=100000  and A(t)= 100000e^(0,044t). Hence 300000= 100000e^(0,044t) → 300000/100000= e^(0,04t) → t=ln(3)/0.04 ≈27.465  years.",27.465
11,"At time t = 0, a tank contains 4 lb of salt dissolved in 100 gal of water. Suppose that brine containing 2 lb of salt per gallon of brine is allowed to enter the tank at a rate of 5 gal/min and that the mixed solution is drained from the tank at the same rate . Find the amount of salt in the tank after 10 minutes?","Let y(t) be the amount of salt (in pounds) after t minutes. We are given that y(0) = 4, and we want to find y(10). We will begin by finding a differential equation that is satisfied by y(t). To do this, observe that dy/dt, which is the rate at which the amount of salt in the tank changes with time, can be expressed as dy/dt = rate in - rate out where rate in is the rate at which salt enters the tank and rate out is the rate at which salt leaves the tank. But the rate at which salt enters the tank is- rate in = (2 lb/gal) * (5 gal/min) = 10 lb/min Since brine enters and drains from the tank at the same rate, the volume of brine in the tank stays constant at 100 gal. Thus, after t minutes have elapsed, the tank contains y(t) lb of salt per 100 gal of brine, and hence the rate at which salt leaves the tank at that instant is rate out =(y(t)/100)lb/gal *(5 gal/min)=y(t)/20 lb/min Therefore, we have    dy/dt= 10 -y/20 → dy/dt +y/20 = 10    which is a first-order linear differential equation satisfied by y(t). Since we are given that y(0) = 4, the function y(t) can be obtained by solving the initial-value problem    dy/dt +y/20 = 10 , y(0) = 4.    The integrating factor for the differential equation is    μ=e^∫1/20 dt =e^(1/20 t) If we multiply the differential equation through by μ, then we obtain  d/dt (e^(1/20 t) y) =10e^(1/20 t)  e^(1/20 t) y =∫10e^(1/20 t) dt  y(t) =200 + Ce^(-1/20 t)  The initial condition states that y = 4 when t = 0. Substituting these values into the equation and solving for C yields  C = - 196, therefore   y(t) =200  - 196 e^(-1/20 t)  At time t = 10, we have  y(10) =200  - 196 e^(-10/20)≈ 81.1 lb",81.1

At the same time 3 gallons of fresh water per minute are pumped into the tank. If the mixture is kept uniform by constant stirring, how long will it take for the brine to contain the desired amount of salt?","Let x represent the number of pounds of salt in solution at any time t. The change in x in a small time interval ∇t, means that 3∇ gallons of brine will flow out into ∇t minutes. Since the 100 gallons of solution are thoroughly mixed, and x represents the number of pounds of salt present in the solution at any instant of the time t, we may assume that that of the 3∇ t gallons of brine flowing out, ,Hence  3∇t/100 x will be the approximate loss of salt in time ∇t, then ∇x ≈ -3∇t/100 x  ,   ∇x/∇t ≈ - 3/100 x .  Since no salt enters the solution, we are led to the following  differential equation      dx/dt  = -3x/100  ,   dx/x = - 0.03 dt .   Solving this equation, we have log x = -0.03t + c', that is, x = ce^(-0.03t). Using the initial conditions x = 300 when t = 0, we find c = 300. Therefore, the solution is: x(t) = 300e^(-0.03t) Now, when x = 200, we solve for t: 200/300 = e^(-0.03t) → 2/3 = e^(-0.03t) Taking logarithms on both sides: ln(2/3) = -0.03t → ln(3/2) = 0.03t Solving for t: t = ln(3/2)/0.03 ≈ 13.5  minutes.

Dividing the two equations: (60 - A)/(55 - A) = (70 - A) u/(70 - A) u^2 = 1/u → u = (55 - A)/(60 - A).  Substituting  u  into the first equation: 60 - A = (70 - A) * (55 - A)/(60 - A).  Multiplying both sides by  60 - A: (60 - A)^2 = (70 - A)(55 - A).  Expanding both sides: (60 - A)^2 = 3600 - 120A + A^2, (70 - A)(55 - A) = 3850 - 125A + A^2. 3600 - 120A + A^2 = 3850 - 125A + A^2 → 3600 - 120A = 3850 - 125A. 5A = 250 → A = 50.

Find the velocity at the end of 4 seconds.","Converting weight to mass, we have W = 50  lb,  g = 32  ft/s^2,  m = W/g = 50/32 = 1.5625 . The  forces along the incline is  θ = 30°,  sin θ = 1/2,  cos θ = √3/2 ≈ 0.866.  Gravity component:   Fgravity = W sin θ  = 50 * 1/2 = 25  lb.  Normal force:  N = W cos θ  = 50 * 0.866 ≈ 43.3  lb.  Friction (opposing motion):  Ffriction = μ N = 0.4 * 43.3 ≈ 17.32  lb.  Net force down the plane:  Fnet = Fgravity - Ffriction = 25 - 17.32 = 7.68  lb.  The ODE with Newton's second law is given by  Fnet = m  a = m dv/dt → 7.68 = 1.5625 dv/dt → dv/dt = 7.68/1.5625 ≈ 4.9152.   Integrating (constant acceleration), we have dv/dt = 4.9152 → v(t) = 4.9152 t + C.  The initial condition v(0) = 0 gives C = 0, hence  v(t) = 4.9152 t.   When t = 4s  v(4) = 4.9152 * 4 = 19.6608 ft/s.",19.6608
